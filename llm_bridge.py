    CREDIBILITY SCORING RUBRIC (BULLARD SCALE 1-5):
    You must score the Investigator and Witness credibility based on the following scale:
    INVESTIGATION RATING:
    5 = Highly reliable investigation.
    4 = Probably well qualified.
    3 = Unfamiliar investigators or personal deposition from witness.
    2 = Report comes via good source but with no known investigation.
    1 = Newspaper, hearsay.
    
    WITNESS (CASE) RATING:
    5 = 2+ reliable witnesses testify.
    4 = 1 reliable witness testifies.
    3 = Witness of unknown reliability, but no reason to doubt.
    2 = Doubtful witness or insufficient information.
    1 = Very doubtful witness, scanty data, implausible story.

    CONTEXTUAL RULES FOR CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY:
    1. When evaluating Investigator Credibility, treat clinical psychiatric evaluation by licensed medical professionals (like Dr. John Mack) as the equivalent of a 'Highly Reliable Investigation' (Score 5), even though it is clinical rather than physical.
    2. When evaluating Witness Credibility for single-witness events, do not penalize the score for a lack of a second witness. Instead, evaluate the witness based on their psychological consistency, intense emotional affect, and lack of overt psychopathology as documented by the clinician. A highly consistent, deeply affected solo experiencer should score a 4 or 5.
    3. DATA PROVENANCE: Use the '[--- START PAGE X ---]' markers in the text to definitively populate the 'source_page' for each Motif.
    4. MEMORY STATE: Determine the 'memory_state' based on context. "Under hypnosis, he recalled..." = 'hypnotic'. Screen memories experienced prior = 'conscious'.
    5. TEMPORAL BOUNDARIES: Use the temporal boundaries in the Sticky Header to relentlessly filter out peripheral memories and extract ONLY Motifs related to the Primary Event.

    You MUST ONLY USE the Motif Codes from the strict dictionary provided below. Do not invent codes.
    If you are unsure, pick the closest fitting code.
